# Python-Text-Game

This is a simple python text game I made with Tkinter allllllll the way back in 2018.  
The structure of the code is there, but it's severely lacking in content.

## Game Features
- Story feature - click next to progress through the saddeningly short story
- Equipment feature
    - choose a wide array of equipment from my equipment library of 2!
- Skills feature
- Items feature

## Setup
- `python main.py` to play
- to restart the game, head into `playerdata.txt` and change the second line to 0 (this line denotes the story)
- to add more dialogue scenes yourself, go to `STGVar.py` and append strings
    - rmb to add the string var into the scenes list
